Lots of stuff id like to do,

-Full mobile support
i believe that my css is displaying weirdly because i used nested code when that isnt fully supported across all devices, i will un-nest all the css from my Style.css file then re-deploy and see where that leaves me.

-Daily macro count / desired calorie goals
-Recommened favourites
-Easier and more managable menu's
-Library use in github pages
-Cleaner Code
